## Screen 1: Welcome

```
[animated flame icon, gentle glow]


hey there


you found burnout
```

**[continue]**

---

## Screen 2: What is Burnout?

```
[illustration: person overwhelmed by floating task bubbles]


burnout isn't laziness
it's your brain protecting itself

when there's too much to do
everything feels impossible
even the small stuff


sound familiar?
```

**[yeah, that's me]** **[tell me more]**

---

## Screen 3: The Problem with Todo Apps

```
[illustration: endless checklist]


most task apps make it worse

they show you everything at once
all the things you haven't done
all the deadlines you're missing

that's not help
that's a guilt trip
```

**[continue]**

---

## Screen 4: A Different Approach

```
[illustration: single task, breathing room]


burnout does it differently

we show you one thing at a time
matched to your energy right now

no endless lists
no guilt
no pressure


just the next small step
```

**[i like that]**

---

## Screen 5: How It Works

```
[3 simple icons with labels]


🔥 tell us what's on your mind
   (brain dump, we'll sort it)

⚡ check in on your energy
   (low? we pick easy wins)

✓ do one thing
   (and feel good about it)


that's it. really.
```

**[let's try it]**

---

## Screen 6: The Promise

```
[gentle orb animation]


we're not here to optimize you
or squeeze more productivity out

we're here so you can
do what matters
without burning out


ready?
```

**[let's go]**

---

## Screen 7: Quick Setup (Optional)

```
what's on your mind right now?

just dump it here
we'll help you sort it later

[large text input]

example: "work stuff, call mom, 
that project I keep avoiding,
groceries maybe"


[skip for now]  [save & continue]
```

---

## Screen 8: First Task (If they entered tasks)

```
alright, let's start small

here's one thing you can do
when you're ready

[shows lowest-energy task from their input]


no rush. whenever you're ready.

[got it]
```

---

## Preloader Screen

```
[animated orb, slow pulse]


one moment...
```

Or more personality:

```
[animated orb]


taking a breath...
```

---

## Loading States Throughout App

Instead of spinners, use calming messages:

- "thinking..."
- "one sec..."
- "finding something gentle..."
- "breathing..."

---

## Error States

### Network Error
```
hmm, we can't connect right now

your tasks are saved locally
so nothing is lost

[try again]  [work offline]
```

### General Error
```
something went wrong
(not your fault)

[try again]
```

---

## Empty States

### No Tasks Yet
```
nothing here yet
and that's okay

when you're ready, tap +
or just tell me what's on your mind
```

### All Tasks Done
```
you did it all ♡

take a break
you've earned it
```

### No Tasks Match Energy
```
nothing matches your energy right now

that's okay — rest is productive too

[show me anyway]  [i'll rest]
```
