# Burnout App - Live Analysis
*Assessment of current state at burnoutapp.vercel.app*

## Current Live State
- **URL**: https://burnoutapp.vercel.app
- **Title**: "BurnOut" 
- **Tech**: React SPA (Single Page Application)
- **Status**: Deployed and accessible
- **Framework**: Appears to be React + TypeScript + Vite (from previous analysis)

## Immediate Assessment Needs
- **Source Access**: Need GitHub repository URL to analyze code
- **Current Features**: Need to explore app functionality 
- **User Flow**: Understanding existing navigation and features
- **Broken Elements**: Identifying what makes it "severely disappointing"

## Action Plan Status
✅ Live app confirmed working
🔍 **BLOCKER**: Need source code repository access
⏳ Waiting for GitHub URL from James
⏳ Waiting for coordination with @1465455482432127036

## Once We Have Repository Access:
1. **Clone and analyze** existing codebase structure
2. **Run locally** for development
3. **Identify critical issues** (starting with ESLint config)
4. **Break down tasks** using OpenCode for atomic operations
5. **Begin parallel development** tracks

## Coordination Ready
- Framework applied ✅
- Work split defined ✅  
- Tools prepared ✅
- Just need code access ✅

*Ready to rock to Glory as soon as we have repo access!* 🚀
