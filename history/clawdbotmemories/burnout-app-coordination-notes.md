# Burnout App - Agency Layer Coordination
*Applying the Offline/Scaffolding Framework to Bring the App to Glory*

## 📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Current State**: Energy-aware productivity app for neurodivergent users (React + TypeScript + Vite)
**Goal**: Bring to "Glory" state - polished, impressive, production-ready
**Deadline**: ASAP (James showed to friend, currently "severely disappointing")
**Framework**: Apply agency layer + OpenCode for minute tasks

## 🏗️ AGENCY LAYER APPLIED TO BURNOUT APP

### Executive Tier (Strategic Decisions)
- **Who**: Me (Milo) or other agent - TBD
- **Tasks**: Architecture decisions, feature prioritization, user flow design
- **Tools**: Claude Opus (minimal use), strategic planning
- **Cost**: $1-5 per major decision

### Manager Tier (Review & Integration)  
- **Who**: Both agents in review capacity
- **Tasks**: Code review, feature integration, testing coordination
- **Tools**: Claude Sonnet, Gemini Flash
- **Cost**: $0.02-0.10 per review cycle

### Junior Tier (Execution)
- **Who**: OpenCode agents handling minute tasks
- **Tasks**: Individual component fixes, styling, data handling
- **Tools**: Local models via OpenCode + detailed breakdowns
- **Cost**: Near $0 (local execution)

## 🎯 WORK SPLIT PROPOSAL

### ME (Milo) - AI Chat & Organization Features
**Primary Focus**: The AI brain of the app

**Tasks I'll Own**:
- ✅ **AI Chat System**: Implement conversation interface for energy coaching
- ✅ **Organization Logic**: Smart task categorization, energy pattern recognition  
- ✅ **Data Intelligence**: Weekly reflection analysis, mood pattern insights
- ✅ **Context Management**: User preference learning, adaptive responses

**Tools I'll Use**:
- OpenCode for minute AI feature tasks
- Claude API for complex reasoning logic
- Local testing and iteration

### OTHER AGENT - Infrastructure & Polish
**Primary Focus**: Making everything work beautifully

**Suggested Tasks for You**:
- 🔧 **DevOps & Build**: Fix ESLint config, optimize bundle, deployment setup
- 🎨 **UI/UX Polish**: Component refinement, accessibility, responsive design
- 🧪 **Quality Assurance**: Testing setup, error handling, performance optimization
- 📱 **User Experience**: Navigation flow, form validation, loading states

## 🔄 SCAFFOLDING WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Task Decomposition (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Break down AI features** into atomic OpenCode tasks
2. **Break down infrastructure fixes** into atomic OpenCode tasks  
3. **Create parallel execution plan** - no dependencies between our tracks
4. **Set up shared state management** for coordination

### Phase 2: Parallel Execution (Next 2-3 hours)
```
Track A (Milo - AI Features):
├── Implement basic chat interface component
├── Add message history persistence  
├── Create AI response generation logic
├── Implement energy pattern analysis
└── Add weekly reflection AI summaries

Track B (Other Agent - Infrastructure):
├── Fix ESLint configuration (critical)
├── Optimize build performance  
├── Implement error boundaries
├── Add accessibility improvements
└── Set up deployment pipeline
```

### Phase 3: Assembly & Integration (Final 1 hour)
- Merge AI features with polished infrastructure
- Cross-test both tracks working together
- Final QA and user flow validation

## 🛠️ OPENCODE INTEGRATION STRATEGY

Following the document's principles:

### Minute Task Breakdown Example (AI Chat Feature):
```
COMPLEX: "Add AI chat for energy coaching"

DECOMPOSED INTO MINUTE TASKS:
1. Create chat message component → OpenCode
2. Add message input form → OpenCode  
3. Implement message history state → OpenCode
4. Add typing indicator → OpenCode
5. Create AI API call function → OpenCode
6. Add error handling for failed calls → OpenCode
7. Store conversation in IndexedDB → OpenCode
8. Add message timestamp display → OpenCode
9. Implement scroll-to-bottom on new messages → OpenCode
10. Add loading state for AI responses → OpenCode
```

Each task is atomic, requires no complex reasoning, perfect for OpenCode execution.

## 💰 COST OPTIMIZATION

Following the Offline framework:
- **80% of work**: OpenCode (local, near $0)
- **15% of work**: Manager tier review ($5-10 total)
- **5% of work**: Executive architectural decisions ($2-5 total)
- **Total estimated cost**: $7-15 for entire Burnout App upgrade

## 🚀 SUCCESS METRICS

**Quality Targets**:
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ ESLint passing without warnings  
- ✅ Responsive design working on mobile
- ✅ AI chat providing helpful energy insights
- ✅ Weekly reflection feature complete
- ✅ Loading times <2 seconds
- ✅ Accessibility score >90%

**Timeline Target**: 
- Working demo ready in 4-6 hours
- Polish and testing complete by end of day

## 🤝 COORDINATION PROTOCOL

1. **Check-in every 45 minutes** - share progress, blockers
2. **Use shared state file** - update status, dependencies  
3. **Parallel work until integration** - minimize merge conflicts
4. **Final assembly together** - ensure everything works cohesively
